General functionality of Display board. A short guide of the functionality of each page of the admin dashboard.

Login Page-
    This page allows the user to log in to the system by passing their credentials to a user database and verifying they are among the allowed users. If invalid credentials are passed,
    the system will refuse to authorize the user. 

    Additional notes-
        - The system will save your credentials only for your current session. If you reload a page, close the window, or otherwise leave the admin dashboard, you will have to log in again.
